I've identified the root cause of the issue:

The `UserControllerTest` fails when run with all tests due to a **database locking conflict**, but succeeds when run alone. Here's what's happening:

1. **Concurrent Test Execution**: When running all tests together, multiple test classes that interact with user and role data run concurrently, accessing the same database tables.

2. **Batch Insert Locking Issue**: The error occurs in the `AceUserRoleService.saveUserRole()` method when it performs a `saveBatch()` operation on the `UserRoleMapper`. This creates locks on the `sys_user_role` table.

3. **Race Condition**: When `UserControllerTest` runs in isolation, there are no competing transactions, so the batch insert completes successfully. But when run with other tests (especially those dealing with user-role relationships), multiple transactions compete for the same database resources.

4. **MySQL Lock Timeout**: The database has a lock wait timeout setting, and when multiple transactions wait for locks on the same resources, one times out with the error "Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction".

The specific issue happens in the `afterSaveOrUpdate` method of `UserController` when it calls `userRoleService.saveUserRole()` to establish user-role relationships, which performs a batch insert operation that conflicts with other tests running simultaneously.
